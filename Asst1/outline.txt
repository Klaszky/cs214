outline mymalloc:

For the user the interface should operate exactly like malloc except for some
error handling situations. 

mymalloc.c
*this will use a struct called metadata that will basically a linked list
	that keeps track of if a certain block of memory is in use, how much space
	there is in said block and if it isn't free gives a pointer to the next free
	chunk.
-create a large char array that will act as the memory mymalloc will give to
	the user
-when the first block of memory is requested create the head of the metadata
	linked list. 
	~this should store the metadata in the char array and return a pointer to
		user that points to the first block after 


outline myfree:

For the user the interface should operate exactly like free except for some
error handling situations. 

myfree.c
-This should take a pointer as input
	~Check the metadata and see if it's already free or not
		=if already free, just report an error
		=if not free, change the metadata to say free and check previous and 
			next pointers. If either are free, combine to free up some more 
			room.
