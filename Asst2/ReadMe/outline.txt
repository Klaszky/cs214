Main():
	-Check user input to make sure that the user 
	provided the correct number of arguments and that it
	is a valid file or directory. 

	If argument was just a file:
		-Call function Extract() to malloc a char[] array the
		size the text file, put all text from file into 
		array.
		-When text is in array: call Tokenize() to get all
		string tokens put them into a data structure. (I'm
		thinking a binary search tree) 

	If argument was a directory:
		-Call function FileIterator() (... I'll try to think
		of a better name...)
			-For each file that is pulled out from
			FileIterator():
				-If valid file:
					-Extract() text
					-Tokenize() strings
					-Put into data structure
				-If directory:
					FileIterator(directory)
				-If not valid file:
					continue;

	After all files have been extracted and tokenized:
		-Create our output document
		-Iterate over data structure sorted by alphabetic 
		order of the string token:
			-For each item, append the string token,
			each file that it appears and the number of times
			it appears in each file.
		-Free everything in the data structure

Extract():
	-Get number of bytes in the file using 
	"int fileLength = lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END);"
	-Return cursor to beginning of file using
	lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET);
	-char fileContents = (char*)malloc(sizeOf(char) * fileLength);
	-Get all bytes out of file. Professor suggested using
	something like this:
		int fd = open("./somefile", <flags>);
		int amount = fileLenght;
		if(fd == -1)
		{
			//opening didn't work
		}

		//Read will return the amount of memory it
		//in bytes that it read in. 
		//Because of the way read works there is no
		//guarantee that it will read all of the memory
		//you ask for. Which is why we need the loop. 
		while(amount > 0)
		{
			status = read(fd,fileContents,amount)
			amount -= status;
		}
	-After all has been extracted return the char array/

Tokenize(char * array):
	-We can essential use that same tokenizer we build for
	assignment 1 with just slight adjustments. So I won't
	go into detail on this one.

FileIterator():
	-I still have to do some research on this, but Professor
	said to use:
		-opendir
		-readdir
			-each time this is call it should return
			the name of the next file or directory
			in the current directory
			-it returns a 'dirent' struct with the the name 
			of the file/directory, but not the path so 
			that's something we'll have to manually keep 
			track of.
	-for each file we get out of readdir:
		-Extract()
		-Tokenize()
